# Raspberry Pi - MATLAB interoperation
This folder contains MATLAB scripts, interpeted / converted from existing codes, mostly based on python/c++. (These files are also in this repository)

For example the `Gy80MatlabV1.m` script connets to a Raspberry Pi and reads the sensor data of a Gy80 IMU. The Gy80 IMU (inertial measurement unit) consists of an accelerometer, a gyro, a magnetometer, a barometer and a thermometer.
