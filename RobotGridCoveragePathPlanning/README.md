# Coverage path planning algorithms on grid maps

Some grid map (occupancy grid) based coverage path planning algorithms implemented in MATLAB.


## 1. Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition 
*Name*: `CoveragePathPlanningBoustrophedon.m`
*Description*: The map is decomposed into cells, and each of them is covered by the robot with simple back and forth motions.


## Example
This is just a demo image not how the algorithm works (right now at least).
