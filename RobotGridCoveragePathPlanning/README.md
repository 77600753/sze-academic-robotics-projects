# Coverage path planning algorithms (CPP) on grid maps

Some grid map (occupancy grid) based coverage path planning algorithms implemented in MATLAB.


## 1. Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition 
*Name*: `CoveragePathPlanningBoustrophedon.m`
*Description*: The map is decomposed into cells, and each of them is covered by the robot with simple back and forth motions.


## Example
This is just a demo image not how the algorithm works (right now at least).

## 2. Iterative structured orientation coverage (ISOC)
*Name*: `CoveragePathPlanningIterativeStructuredOrientation.m`
*Description*: Own developed algorithm.


## Example
Later.
